Topic: Kubernetes Container Orchestration
Summary: Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

The platform's architecture includes a control plane and worker nodes. The control plane manages the overall cluster, while worker nodes host the actual applications. Key components include the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and kubelet. These components work together to ensure applications are running as desired.

Kubernetes offers features like automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, and service discovery. It supports various container runtimes, including Docker and containerd. Its flexibility and scalability have made it a popular choice for modern application deployment.
